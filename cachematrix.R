##    Program Description:
##    These 2 functions (makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve) will implement a program to calculate the inverse matrix    
##    given an invertible matrix.
##    
##    Function 1:
##    makeCacheMatrix() will create a special matrix object that will cache the inverse matrix
##
##    Function 2:    
##    cacheSolve() will conpute the inverse of the special matrix returned by makeCacheMatrix(). If the inverse has 
##    already been calculated and the matrix has not changed, then cacheSolve() will return the inverse from cache.

##
##    cacheSolve() will conpute the inverse of the special matrix returned by makeCacheMatrix(). If the inverse has 
##    already been calculated and the matrix has not changed, then cacheSolve() will return the inverse from cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
